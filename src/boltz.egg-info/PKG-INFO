## Introduction

Boltz-1 is the state-of-the-art open-source model to predict biomolecular structures containing combinations of proteins, RNA, DNA, and other molecules. It also supports modified residues, covalent ligands and glycans, as well as conditioning the prediction on specified interaction pockets or contacts. 

All the code and weights are provided under MIT license, making them freely available for both academic and commercial uses. For more information about the model, see our [technical report](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.19.624167). To discuss updates, tools and applications join our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/boltz-community/shared_invite/zt-2zj7e077b-D1R9S3JVOolhv_NaMELgjQ).

## Installation
Install boltz with PyPI (recommended):

```
pip install boltz -U
```

or directly from GitHub for daily updates:

```
git clone https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz.git
cd boltz; pip install -e .
```
> Note: we recommend installing boltz in a fresh python environment

## Inference

You can run inference using Boltz-1 with:

```
boltz predict input_path --use_msa_server
```

Boltz currently accepts three input formats:

1. Fasta file, for most use cases

2. A comprehensive YAML schema, for more complex use cases

3. A directory containing files of the above formats, for batched processing

To see all available options: `boltz predict --help` and for more information on these input formats, see our [prediction instructions](docs/prediction.md).

## Evaluation

To encourage reproducibility and facilitate comparison with other models, we provide the evaluation scripts and predictions for Boltz-1, Chai-1 and AlphaFold3 on our test benchmark dataset as well as CASP15. These datasets are created to contain biomolecules different from the training data and to benchmark the performance of these models we run them with the same input MSAs and same number  of recycling and diffusion steps. More details on these evaluations can be found in our [evaluation instructions](docs/evaluation.md).

## Training

If you're interested in retraining the model, see our [training instructions](docs/training.md).

## Contributing

We welcome external contributions and are eager to engage with the community. Connect with us on our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/boltz-community/shared_invite/zt-2zj7e077b-D1R9S3JVOolhv_NaMELgjQ) to discuss advancements, share insights, and foster collaboration around Boltz-1.
